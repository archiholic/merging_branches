# trying to _________ branches!


I have created a new branch
>> git branches       # to see what branches i already have
>> git branch crazy_experiment      # creates a new branch called crazy_exp
>> git checkout crazy_experiment    # working on crazy_exp branch


>> git checkout -b crazy_experiment   # this is a short hand for the last two steps!
